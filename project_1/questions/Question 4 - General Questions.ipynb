    "This project deals with the **SLAM Backend**. We have the odometry and sensor data available to us, as well as the predicted trasforms between the sensed images using ICP or similar algorithm. This project starts with the SLAM problem after the SLAM frontend has generated an initial estimate of the pose transforms between the different observations, and has some belief state on the n points, and the SLAM backend serves to **optimize out the errors** using Loop closures as a trick.\n",

Then we write all that data as constraints and attach appropriate weights to them, and feed it to the SLAM backend, where the ICP SLAM algorithm helps find coordinates which minimizes the weighted loss from all those sensors."
